# MinetweakerScriptManager
MTSM (or Minetweaker Script Manager) is a tool to help manage the several Zenscript files for a modpack.
It will be able to find the launcher, locate all packs within the launcher, and then manage different scripts accordingly.
If you have FTBTweaks installed in the pack, MTSM will know that and help you manage scripts across multiple gamemodes.

# Original
The original MTSM is based in the language Batchfile.
I originally wrote it in that for a handy easy to use utility but ended up rewriting it in C++ for other users.
I would've kept it in Batch but it has an invisible Unicode character somewhere in the file, so instead of rewriting it in Batch, I would make this an opportunity to learn a new language.
The C++ struggle begins.

# Issues
If any issues arise let me know using the issues tab.
If you end up reading over the code and find that I can make some improvements; tweet me @OscarXcore.
I will disregard any improvements that suggest changes in my techniques (EX: Comment your work, Don't comment your work, etc.); Anything else I will take as decent advice (EX: Instead of 5 lines for a certain function, here is how you can do the same thing in 2 lines.).
